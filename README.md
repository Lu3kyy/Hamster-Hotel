//peer review: Pallavi Pattanashetti-The Website looks great, good job! I have few suggestions here-Please make the image in the “Welcome to Hamestar Paradise” section a little shorter in height. In the “Our Room” section, add more space between the lines for easier reading. Also, make small images and logos hide elements for on small screens. Other than these small changes, everything looks perfect.
